#### Problem 2

Expand upon the code in cell 3 to find the probability of outlier in Box Plot applied to exponential data with parameter $\lambda=0.01$.

##### Hints

1. Find the value of Q3,
2. Find the value of IQR,
3. Find the probability of an outlier, $F(Q_1-IQR)+(1-F(Q_3+IQR))â€‹$
4. Make sure to print the values of Q1, Q3, IQR and probability of an outlier

#### Problem 3

In cell 4, you will analyze data from Kaggle Titanic training data set, KaggleTitanicTrain.xslx. Please perform the following tasks:
1. Use Panda to import the KaggleTitanicTrain.xslx file into a dataframe,
2. Used the describe command to calculate summary statistics for each variable,
3. Construct box plots for each variable, and
4. Construct a scatter matrix.
